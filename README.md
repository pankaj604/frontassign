HELLO

I have deliberately prioritized functionality over the aesthetic aspects of the user interface for two key reasons. First, my primary focus is to ensure that the project's target goals and functionalities are effectively implemented and fully operational. Second, given the absence of specific UI guidelines within the assignment, my approach has been to emphasize functionality and usability, ensuring that the application performs its intended tasks efficiently. While a polished user interface can enhance the user experience, my primary objective is to deliver a robust and fully functional solution that meets the assignment's requirements.


I have chosen to convert the CSV file into a JSON format for the task at hand. This decision aligns with my expertise as a MERN stack developer, where MongoDB is a primary database choice. Working with JSON data structures allows for seamless integration with the MongoDB database and leverages my strong knowledge of JSON data manipulation. This approach ensures efficiency and effectiveness in handling and processing data for the project.

MongoDB, as a NoSQL database, offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for various applications. Here are some of the advantages of MongoDB

Flexible Schema: MongoDB is schema-less, which means it can handle a variety of data types and structures. This flexibility is particularly useful in applications where data models evolve over time.

Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic. You can add more servers to your MongoDB cluster to distribute the load and increase capacity.

High Performance: MongoDB provides high-speed data retrieval due to its support for indexing and efficient query execution. It's suitable for real-time analytics and applications requiring fast data access.

Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in a document format, similar to JSON. This allows developers to work with data in a way that's more natural and intuitive, simplifying the development process.

Auto-Sharding: MongoDB can automatically distribute data across multiple servers using sharding. This helps maintain performance as the dataset grows and ensures data availability.

Replication: MongoDB supports replica sets, which provide data redundancy and high availability. If one server fails, another can automatically take over, reducing the risk of data loss.

Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data analysis and transformations directly within the database.

Ad Hoc Queries: Developers can query MongoDB without needing to define the structure of the data beforehand. This is especially helpful during the development phase when data structures are evolving.

Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community, as well as a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and services that make it easier to work with and extend MongoDB.
